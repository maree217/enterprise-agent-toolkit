# Why Not Big Consulting? The AI Implementation Reality Check

## Executive Summary

**The Question CTOs Ask:** *"Why shouldn't I just hire Accenture/Deloitte/IBM for AI transformation?"*

**The Honest Answer:** Big consulting works great if you have £2M+, 18+ months, and want to build internal AI capabilities slowly while paying premium rates for junior consultants to learn on your dime.

**The Alternative:** AI Implementation as a Service - Rapid, affordable, capability-transferring transformation that gets you results in weeks, not years.

## The Big Consulting Reality vs Your Needs

### **What Big Consulting Delivers:**
| Aspect | Big Consulting Approach | Your Actual Need |
|--------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Timeline** | 12-24 months "transformation journey" | Results in 2-8 weeks |
| **Team Size** | 15-50 consultants | 1-3 experts who know what they're doing |
| **Cost Structure** | £200-500K+ (with scope creep guarantees) | £25-150K with fixed deliverables |
| **Expertise Level** | Junior consultants learning AI on your project | Senior practitioners with proven track record |
| **Implementation** | Theoretical frameworks and PowerPoints | Working code deployed to production |
| **Knowledge Transfer** | Generic training programs | Hands-on capability building |

### **The Real Cost Comparison:**

#### **Big Consulting: "Enterprise AI Strategy & Implementation"**
- **Initial Engagement:** £150K (3-month strategy phase)
- **Implementation Phase 1:** £400K (6-month pilot development)  
- **Implementation Phase 2:** £600K (12-month rollout)
- **Change Management:** £200K (ongoing training and adoption)
- **Total First Year:** £1.35M
- **Time to Working System:** 18+ months
- **Actual Working Agents:** 2-3 basic chatbots

#### **AI Implementation as a Service: Level 1→2→3 Progressive Implementation**
- **Level 1 Quick Wins:** £25-50K (4-8 weeks to working agents)
- **Level 2 Analytics:** £50-100K (3-6 months to insights)
- **Level 3 Transformation:** £100-200K (6-12 months to revolution)
- **Total Progressive Investment:** £175-350K over 18 months
- **Time to First Working System:** 2-4 weeks
- **Actual Working Agents:** 10-20 production-ready agents

## Why Big Consulting Struggles with AI Implementation

### **1. The "Strategy First" Trap**
**Big Consulting Approach:**
- 3-6 months creating AI strategy documents
- Extensive stakeholder interviews and workshops  
- Detailed roadmaps and governance frameworks
- Committee-based decision making

**The Problem:**
- AI moves too fast for 6-month planning cycles
- You learn what works by building, not by strategizing
- By the time strategy is approved, technology has evolved

**Better Approach:**
- Start building working agents in week 1
- Strategy emerges from what actually works
- Continuous adaptation based on real results

### **2. The "Junior Consultant Learning" Problem**
**Big Consulting Reality:**
- Partner sells the vision (£2000/day rate)
- Senior consultant manages the project (£1200/day rate)  
- Junior consultants do the actual work (£600/day rate, learning AI)
- Your project becomes their AI training ground

**The Result:**
- Paying premium rates for people learning AI basics
- Generic solutions copied from other industries
- Limited depth of technical understanding
- Theoretical knowledge without practical experience

### **3. The "Scope Creep Guarantee"**
**How Big Consulting Projects Really Work:**
```
Month 1-3: "We need to understand your data landscape first" (+£150K)
Month 4-6: "Integration is more complex than expected" (+£200K)  
Month 7-9: "Change management requires additional workstreams" (+£150K)
Month 10-12: "We should pilot in more departments" (+£300K)
Month 13-18: "Production deployment needs additional security review" (+£200K)
```

**Total:** Original £500K becomes £1.5M+ with questionable results

### **4. The "Technology Vendor Lock-in" Issue**
**Big Consulting Dependencies:**
- Locked into their preferred technology stacks
- Expensive licenses for their "proprietary" platforms
- Ongoing dependency on their support models
- Limited ability to pivot to better solutions

**Independent Approach:**
- Best-of-breed technology selection
- Microsoft ecosystem optimization (if applicable)
- Future-proof, standards-based implementations
- Complete knowledge transfer and independence

### **What CTOs Actually Need:**

#### **Immediate Pain Relief (Level 1)**
- Working AI agents solving real problems in weeks

### **What Big Consulting Actually Delivers:**

#### **Extensive Documentation (Months 1-6)**
- 200-page AI strategy documents
- Governance frameworks and committee structures
- Risk assessments and compliance matrices
- Detailed project plans with dependencies

#### **Pilot Projects (Months 7-12)**
- Proof-of-concept chatbots with limited functionality
- Integration challenges and technical debt
- Change management resistance and adoption issues
- Requests for additional budget and timeline extensions

#### **"Transformation" (Months 13-24)**
- Scaled versions of basic pilots
- Training programs for business users
- Handover documentation and support transitions

## The "Fast, Good, Cheap - Pick Two" Myth

**Traditional Consulting Wisdom:** "You can have it fast, good, or cheap - but not all three."

**AI Implementation Reality:** With the right expertise and approach, you can have all three because:

### **Fast is Possible Because:**
- Pre-built templates and proven patterns
- Microsoft ecosystem leverages existing investments
- Avoiding the "invention" phase through proven methodologies
- Focus on working code, not endless planning

### **Good is Guaranteed Because:**
- Senior practitioners, not junior consultants learning
- Production-proven implementations across industries
- Real measurable outcomes, not theoretical frameworks
- Continuous improvement based on actual results

### **Cheap is Achievable Because:**
- No massive consulting teams and overhead
- Efficient delivery through proven templates and methods
- Rapid value realization reduces total cost of ownership
- Knowledge transfer eliminates ongoing dependencies

## When Big Consulting Actually Makes Sense

### **You Should Consider Big Consulting If:**

1. **Scale Requirements**
   - Need 100+ consultants simultaneously
   - Multi-year, multi-geography rollouts
   - Complex regulatory/compliance requirements
   - Existing relationship with embedded teams

2. **Political Considerations**
   - Board requires "brand name" consulting validation
   - Internal politics demand extensive stakeholder management
   - Risk-averse culture needs extensive documentation
   - Procurement policies mandate large vendor selection

3. **Budget Availability**
   - £2M+ dedicated AI transformation budget
   - Multi-year funding commitments secured
   - Cost is less important than perceived credibility
   - "Nobody gets fired for hiring IBM" mentality

### **You Should Choose AI Implementation as a Service If:**

1. **Results Focus**
   - Need working AI agents in weeks, not months
   - Want measurable ROI before major investments
   - Prefer iterative improvement over big-bang approaches
   - Value technical depth over consulting theater

2. **Practical Constraints**
   - Budget under £500K for AI initiatives
   - Need results within current fiscal year
   - IT team needs to maintain ongoing ownership
   - Want to avoid vendor lock-in dependencies

3. **Competitive Urgency**
   - Market opportunities require rapid AI deployment
   - Competitors are gaining AI advantages
   - Customer expectations demand immediate improvement
   - Innovation cycles are measured in quarters, not years

## The Real Question: What's Your AI Transformation Goal?

### **If Your Goal is:** *"Appear to be doing AI transformation while minimizing risk and maximizing stakeholder buy-in"*
**Then:** Big consulting is perfect. You'll get impressive presentations, extensive documentation, and plausible deniability if results don't materialize.

### **If Your Goal is:** *"Actually transform operations with AI to gain competitive advantage"*  
**Then:** You need rapid, practical implementation that delivers working agents and measurable results quickly.
